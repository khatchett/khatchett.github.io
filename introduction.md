<h1>Journey to OSCP</h1>

Greetings!

my name is Tina and I am a Security Analyst for a financial services org. 	I have many motivating interests in the infosec field but by far the biggest motivation has been to become a penetration tester or work on a red team. In order to achieve my goal I am going after the OSCP certification. I do have some eperience with the course that leads to the certification (Penetration Testing with Kali) but I did not sit for the exam, before spending more money on lab time I plan on using the knowledge I gained from the labs to work on the parts I really struggled with. 

The OSCP is a pretty popular certification and luckily the infosec community is very sharing so there is a large amount resources available to use for preparation. As I go on this journey I plan on updating this website with my lessons learned and any tips/tutorials I can help contribute

If you read this far, I thank you
